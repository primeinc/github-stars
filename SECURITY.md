## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Preferred Reporting Method

Please report security vulnerabilities using [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/primeinc/github-stars/security/advisories/new).

This allows us to:
- Assess and respond to the issue privately
- Coordinate a fix before public disclosure
- Publish a security advisory when appropriate

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
